        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Hot Chocolate, also known as hot cocoa or drinking chocolate, is a heated drink consisting of shaved chocolate, <br>
            melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener, and may typically be garnished with whipped cream or marshmallows. <br>
            Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.
